Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Why TDD?

I am committed to delivering high-quality, bug-free software. By following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:

    Every feature is backed by comprehensive test cases.
    Bugs are identified and resolved before changes are committed.
    Continuous Integration ensures stability throughout development.

Tests Implemented

    Unit tests for backend logic.
    Integration tests for critical workflows like course enrollment and point calculations.
    Security tests to validate role-based permissions and prevent unauthorized access.

Tech Stack

    Backend: Django and Django REST Framework
    Database: PostgreSQL
    Authentication: Token-based (with JWT)
    Testing: Django’s Test Framework
    DevOps: Docker for containerization
